                <p>I have just started my journey to become a <i>Junior Web Developer (JWD)</i> by studying through Generation's JWD Program.
                <br>I was born and raised in Sydney. My background is Vietnamese and growing up I spoke Vietnamese at home.
                <br>After finishing school, I studied Accounting at Macquarie University where I also met my husband.
                <br>My husband and I welcomed a baby girl into our family in February 2020.
                <br>Currently my days are spent on the JWD Program and time with my daughter.</p>
