            <h3 id="aboutMe">A little bit about me...</h3>
                <p> I recently decided to study a course through Generation to pursue a career as a Junior Web Developer (JWD).
                <br>I wanted to be part of a growing industry where I can learn new in demand skills, be part of a community and help improve tech user experience.
                <br>I consider myself to be a happy go getter and a glass half full kind of person who would go above and beyond to help others.
                <br>My <i>creativity</i>, <i>persistence</i>, and <i>drive for perfection</i> would also help me to succeed in this career.</p>
                    
                <p> I was born and raised in Sydney, Australia and my husband and I recently welcomed our baby girl into the family.
                <br>Outside of study, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, cooking, watching comedy shows and painting my nails.</p>
